1. An algorithm that has O(1) is as fast as a plane whereas an algorithm with O(2^n) could be as slow as walking.

2. The best case scenario for binary search is that the element being searched for is the first element tried (the last element in the list).

3. The worst case scenario is that the element being searched for is the last element tried.

4. The bonded case scenario is that the element being searched for is between the best and worse case scenario.
