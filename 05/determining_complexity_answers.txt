1. O(1)
  There is always only one element and it only outputs the element, nothing variable happens.

2. O(n)
  It iterates through the collection of n elements so, it takes a time equivalent to the number of elements.

3. O(n log n)
  While this at first appears linear, with closer inspection, each element is it's own collection which is iterated through as well so I believe this is loglinear.

4. O(log n)
  This is very similar to binary search.  It is recursive with two calls for each iteration.

5. O(n)
  We iterate through the collection until we get near n so this is linear even though it has a non-variable term of -2.

6. O(n log n)
  This one is more difficult but I believe that it is loglinear because it is recursive but seems like there is more too it than a straight log.
